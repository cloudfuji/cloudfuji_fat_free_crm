#
# Default application settings to be loaded during installation:
#
#   rake crm:settings:load
#

# Host
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Host for URLS when action mailer generates emails.
#
# When sending email, you will need to set the host name so that the mailer can
# generate urls inside emails that point back to your site. Unlike controllers
# from Action Pack, the mailer instance doesn’t have any context about the
# incoming request, so you’ll need to provide all of the details needed to
# generate a URL.
#
# :host: "http://www.example.com"
#
:host: http://<%= ENV['CLOUDFUJI_DOMAIN'] %>/

# http://www.domain.com/crm   => :base_url: "/crm"   # (without trailing slash)
